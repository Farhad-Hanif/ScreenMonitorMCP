## Overview

ScreenMonitorMCP is a powerful Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI with real-time vision capabilities. This project enhances user interface intelligence, allowing AI to truly "see" and understand the digital world. Unlike traditional screen capture methods, ScreenMonitorMCP enables a deeper interaction with the content displayed on your screen.

## Features

- **Real-Time Vision**: Monitor your screen and provide AI with instant feedback.
- **Enhanced UI Intelligence**: AI can analyze and interact with user interfaces more effectively.
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrate with existing AI frameworks.
- **Python Support**: Built with Python for easy customization and extensibility.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to the project and help improve AI capabilities.
